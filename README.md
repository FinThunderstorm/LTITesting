# Toskaboiler

Toskaboiler is a boilerplate for anyone wanting to get a kickstart on mono-repo react - fullstack project. It contains all the parts that are common in toska projects.

## Short tutorial

The project is split into 2 parts: client and server while index.js in root works as the main file. The project contains no database dependant parts.

### node_modules

The node_modules folder is inside the container. Some dependencies are installed based on the machine running "npm install" so a mismatch may happen if you do so.

## How users can get started with Toskaboiler

Clone the repo, install docker to get started!

```bash
npm run start
```

To start the project in development mode use this command. It will start everything in development mode.

## Stuck?

```bash
npm run reset
```

To reset everything. This will remove volumes and rebuild the docker images.

Please note that npm test doesn't do anything, this is intentional: testing framework is all up to you.

### Github actions
There's a bare bones github actions setup at .github/workflows. It pushes a docker image to   
`toska/{{ github.event.repository.name }}`.
